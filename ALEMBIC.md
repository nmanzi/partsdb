# Alembic Migrations

This project includes Alembic for schema versioning. The Alembic environment is configured to use the SQLAlchemy `DATABASE_URL` from `backend/database.py` and the application's `Base.metadata` for autogeneration.

Common commands (run from the project root):

```bash
# install/update dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# create an autogenerated revision (requires imports to be resolvable from project root)
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe change"

# apply migrations
alembic upgrade head

# view current revision
alembic current
```

If you use a virtual environment, activate it first (`source .venv/bin/activate`).

Notes:
- The Alembic `env.py` imports `backend.database` to obtain `DATABASE_URL` and `Base.metadata`.
- To autogenerate migrations, ensure the project root is on `PYTHONPATH` or run `alembic` from the project root so imports succeed.
